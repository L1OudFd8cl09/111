## Impact
+ Attackers can exploit this vulnerability to upload malicious files without restriction, which can lead to file overwrite, file injection, directory traversal attacks, and denial of service attacks. Exploiting malicious files can lead to remote attacks on RCE
# DESCRIPTION
+ The file upload operation was triggered on line 13 of the "change_profile_picture.php" file, and the uploaded file was received using the "$- FILES" variable. Due to the lack of appropriate input validation and cleaning, remote attackers only need to use regular user login to pass malicious payloads through this file upload function, resulting in unrestricted file uploads, which may further lead to remote code execution (RCE).
