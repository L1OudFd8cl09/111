+ In line 8 of the editproduct.php file, the input obtained through $-FILES is directly used to determine the storage location of the file without verification or cleaning. The specific code snippet is as follows:
+ ![1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f42f1cd9-0739-4436-b847-c64288b4aa44)
## Impact
+ Attackers can exploit this vulnerability for unrestricted uploads, which may lead to file overwrite, file injection, directory traversal attacks, and denial of service attacks. Remote attacks may also result in RCE
# DESCRIPTION
+ N3xu5Cr4ck37 discovered that the file upload operation was triggered on line 80 of the 'editproduct.php' file and the uploaded file was received using the '$_FILES' variable. Due to the lack of appropriate input validation and cleaning, remote attackers can pass malicious payloads through this file upload feature, resulting in unrestricted file uploads, which may further lead to remote code execution (RCE).
